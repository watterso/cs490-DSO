How to import into eclipse:
	1. Create a new java project in your workspace via File->New->Java Project
	2. In the new project dialog, uncheck 'Use default location' and browse to the folder containing the src file SOME_PATH/project2/

Then run the files with the correct parameters as described below.

If you would rather compile via command line:
	1. Navigate to the 'src' directory
	2. Run javac part1/(TODO client file here).java
	3. Run javac part1/(TODO register server here).java

	for broadcast type use 0 - reliable, 1 - FIFO
	Use the command line to send messages
